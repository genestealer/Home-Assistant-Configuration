# This configuration has been moved to its own file.
# Instead of importing the entire `device_base.yaml` file and using "status_led: !remove" to remove the status_led configuration from it, we simply avoid importing it altogether.
# This approach prevents the incorrect warning message about "unknown tag <!remove>" which is valid but not recognized correctly by VSCode.
# For more details, refer to: https://esphome.io/components/packages.html#remove
