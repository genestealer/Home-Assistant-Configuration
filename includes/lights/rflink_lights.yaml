# Q: I need help unlearning one of the sockets. It turns on two lamps as programmed but I no longer want it to do this. Anone know how please?
# A: Yes you can.Press and hold the "Learn" button on the adaptor for about 3 secs until the light remains flashing, then select and hold the "Off" button corresponding to the number 1-4 switch you want off and hold it down until the Learn light stops flashing on the adaptor.
# This will have de-selected that switch setting and you can then re learn it if you wish
